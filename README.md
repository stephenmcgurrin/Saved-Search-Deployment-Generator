# NetSuite Script Formatter 🧾

A simple Python GUI application that helps format NetSuite Saved Search scripts. Designed for consultants, developers, and NetSuite admins, this tool makes it easy to generate a properly structured `search.create`. It is based on the wonderful work by Chidi Okwudire on his [NetSuite Insights Blog](https://netsuite.smash-ict.com/saved-search-deployment-failed-try-this-before-resorting-to-manual-deployment/)
