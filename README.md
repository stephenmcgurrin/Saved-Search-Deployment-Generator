# NetSuite Script Formatter 🧾

A simple Python GUI application that helps format NetSuite Saved Search scripts. Designed for consultants, developers, and NetSuite admins, this tool makes it easy to inject metadata like title, ID, and description, and generate properly structured `search.create` JavaScript code for use in SuiteScript. It is based on the wonderful work by Chidi Okwudire on his [NetSuite Insights Blog](https://netsuite.smash-ict.com/saved-search-deployment-failed-try-this-before-resorting-to-manual-deployment/)


## ✨ Features

- 📝 Paste your NetSuite Saved Search creation code
- 🔤 Add a custom search name, ID, and description
- 🔄 Automatically generate a formatted `require(['N/search'], function(search) { ... })` script
- 💾 Save the result as a JavaScript file
- 👀 Preview the formatted script before saving
- 🧹 Clear the form easily for multiple use cases
